## Git Ignore Utility
The purpose of the Git Ignore Utility tool is to easily add or remove files from the .gitignore file of the project.

### How To Use
When you right-click on any folder or file in the Project Window in Unity, you will see two self-explanatory options: "Add to .gitignore" and "Remove from .gitignore."

Additionally, under Tools > GitIgnore Settings, you have the option to change the path of the .gitignore file if you keep it somewhere other than the root for some reason.
Note: If your project doesn't have a .gitignore file, adding any item or folder to .gitignore will automatically create a default Unity .gitignore file for you.
